            <h3>CSDS 393 - Todo Student Planner</h3>
            <p>
            In CSDS 393, Software Engineering, we had the opportunity to work in teams to complete a hosted web application with the use of a database. 
            Our team worked to create a student-centered planner application: Todo. Unlike traditional planners, our planner combined the best aspects of a to-do list and a planner into one application.
            On the application's main page, users have the option to create a task and include a description, due date, due time, and category. 
            Other functionalities include deleting tasks, marking tasks complete, and our largest feature: the ability to sort tasks.
            We had found that traditional planners lack the ability to prioritize tasks, so we made that a priority in our development.
            With Todo, you have the option to sort your tasks by time created or by due date. This way, you have a clear view of what needs to get done.
            To complete the project, all teams followed their own modified Scrum approach with accompanying documentation and used GitHub to collaborate on our code and deploy our project.
            Using the Agile methodologies covered during class time, our team decided on a modified approach that worked around our other academic and extracurricular committments.
            Along with our methodology, we also kept extensive documentation throughout the iterative development process.
            Using the respective links below, you can access our hosted web application, documentation, and GitHub.
