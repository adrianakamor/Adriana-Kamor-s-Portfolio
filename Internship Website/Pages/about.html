            <h2>My name is Adriana, and I'm excited to explore my passion for communication through technology.</h2>
            <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
            <p>
                I am passionate about utilizing technology in different forms to bridge communication and experiences across the globe.
                Whether through a game, website, or other application, technology has the unique power to transcend all barriers.
                No matter where anyone is from, in the modern world we all share the language of technology, and I believe that there is endless opportunities to use this common ground.
                I started coding in the Hour of Code club at my middle school during lunches, and was in awe of how many things you could achieve with a simple line of code.
                I started creating games and various projects through Khan Academy, and my love for technology grew from there.
                I specifically have a lot of interest in the overlap of technology and creativity.

            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>
                When not doing schoolwork or technology-related projects, I love to explore creative means
                of expression. Some of my favorite hobbies include music, poetry, language learning, and embroidery.
                <br>
                <br>
                &emsp; For music, I love to perform, produce, compose, and arrange a variety of genres and types of instruments.
                I enjoy playing the cello, piano, ukulele, violin, viola, and have recently taken up clarinet.
                With instruments and the grace of GarageBand, I have made a variety of covers to some of my favorite songs,
                and arrange pop and rock music.
                I also love composing original classical pieces, mainly for strings.
                I have 3 copyrighted pieces and a lot in the works!
                <br>
                <br>
                &emsp; For poetry, I write both slam and "regular" poetry. Poetry has been an amazing way to release my emotions
                in a unique way, because sometimes it's too hard to state your feelings outright. Poetry paints a vivid picture
                of emotions while also approaching issues indirectly. Recently, I have created a website for my poetry called
                "The Imperfect Poet Project" as an effort to increase transparency about mental health issues and reduce stigma.
                On this site, I have posted all of my poems going back to 2017, most of which chronicle my mental health journey.
                Although this may be percieved as vulnerable, I view it as a milestone in my mental health journey because I am now comfortable
                sharing my experiences with others.

                &emsp; For language learning, I have always been passionate for learning about different cultures and languages around the world.
                Since, middle school I have been learning French and achieved the New York State Seal of Biliteracy in my senior year of high school.
                Fluent in French and English(my native language), I was looking to explore new learning opportunities. One of my French teachers in high
                school had said a quote that changed my perception of language learning: "If you speak a common language with someone, you are speaking to
                their brain. If you speak their language, you speak to their heart." Since then, I have made an effort to explore other cultures and languages to
                connect with new people and friends. I am currently learning Norwegian and Italian. I am also doing a little Dutch for an upcoming trip to Europe!
