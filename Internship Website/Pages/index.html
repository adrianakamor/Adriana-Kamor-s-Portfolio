            <h2>Welcome to my website/portfolio.</h2>
            <p>
                This website was made by myself thanks to the power of
                HTML, CSS, and GitHub. It's a little rustic, but there's always room
                for improvement. 
                <br>
                There are a few pages to give you a better idea of who I am,
                what I'm passionate about, and what skills I bring to the table.
                Thank you so much for visiting my website, and 
                I hope you enjoy exploring it and my work!
                <br>
                <br>
                Smiles, 
                <br>
